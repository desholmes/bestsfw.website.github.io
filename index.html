			<h1>This is <em>the best</em> (<abbr title="Safe For Work">SFW</abbr>) website</h1>
			<aside>And it's perfect.</aside>
		</header>
		<h2>Seriously, what else do you want?</h2>
		<p>You keep forgetting. Let me describe this website:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Lightweight and loads fast.</li>
			<li>Fits on all screens.</li>
			<li>Looks the same in all browsers.</li>
			<li>Accessible to everyone that visits your site.</li>
			<li>
				Legible and gets the point across (if you had one instead of just a
				5MB background video of hipsters poking at their iPhones).
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			You do it every day. You take
			<a title="Motherf**king Website" href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">a (<abbr title="Not Safe For Work">NSFW</abbr>) masterpiece</a>
			and incrementally
			<a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com" title="Better Motherf**king Website">ruin it</a>
			for the sake of design. Let me remind you: design is
			<dfn title="design">to plan and make something for a specific purpose</dfn>. The most basic purpose of text
			on a website is to be read. Yet you
			keep doing stuff that gets in the way.
		</p>
		<h3 id="grey-text">Quit messing around with grey text</h3>
		<p>
			<a title="Contrast Rebellion" href="http://contrastrebellion.com/">Text contrast is not a bad thing</a>. The
			print on your newspaper is not true black, nor is the text on
			your screen. These are limitations, not ideals. Stop making it worse.
		</p>
		<h3 id="remote-fonts">Remote fonts are wasting your time and mine</h3>
		<p>
			Why are you loading 500kB of font to render 50kB of content? Are your
			users even going to notice that it's not their default serif or
			sans-serif? Why do you even bother when Chrome is going to render it
			poorly anyways? Use a
			<a href="http://www.awayback.com/index.php/2010/02/03/revised-font-stack/" title="Revised Font Stack">font
				stack your users already have</a>.
		</p>
		<h2>Your website is more than just HTML</h2>
		<h3 id="use-https">You have no excuse for using HTTP.</h3>
		<p>
			Why are you still delivering sites over HTTP? An Atom 330 CPU from 2008
			can perform aes-256-cbc encryption via OpenSSL at 110 megabits per
			second. An Xeon E5-2670 CPU without AES-NI enabled hits 444 megabits per
			second. With AES-NI enabled it hits a staggering 2.2 gigabits per
			second. Your server probably can't even load your JavaScript framework's
			dependencies that fast.
		</p>
		<p>
			TLS certificates are cheap. Seriously, you can
			<a href="https://www.namecheap.com/security/ssl-certificates/comodo/positivessl"
				title="COMODO PositiveSSL Certificate via Namecheap">get them for US$6</a>. You paid twice that much for
			your idiotic domain name. You can even
			get them for free from
			<a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" title="Let's Encrypt Free Certificate Authority">Let's Encrypt</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			HTTPS
			<a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal.html"
				title="Google announces HTTPS support to affect pagerank">improves your search ranking</a>
			so people are more likely to find your ramblings on the Google. It's
			also required for
			<a href="https://http2.github.io/faq/#does-http2-require-encryption"
				title="HTTP/2 Frequently Asked Questions">HTTP/2 support</a>
			which allows browsers to fetch resources more efficiently.
		</p>
		<h3 id="compression">This is gzipped</h3>
		<p>
			Your webserver is perfectly capable of compressing HTML. An Atom 330 CPU
			can perform single-core <code>gzip -6</code> on random data at 51
			megabits per second. An Xeon E5-2670 from 2012 can do this at 216
			megabits per second. Your meme website isn't as random as you think it
			is and will compress much faster.
		</p>
		<h3 id="caching">Cache is Money</h3>
		<p>
			It's bad enough you're forcing users to load 5MB of hero image and
			JavaScript framework. Why are you making them reload it every time they
			visit your website? Bandwidth is cheap but it isn't free. Via data
			charges or waiting, someone is paying for your laziness.
		</p>
		<h2>This is a website. Look at it. You've never seen one before</h2>
		<p>
			Like the man who's never grown out his beard has no idea what his true
			natural state is, you have no idea what a website is. All you have ever
			seen are skeuomorphic mutations of what should be text communicating a
			message. This is a real, naked website. Look at it. It's beautiful.
		</p>
		<h3>Yes, this is satire</h3>
		<p>
			I'm not actually saying your site should look like this. What I'm saying
			is that all the problems we have with websites are
			<strong>ones we create ourselves</strong>. Websites aren't broken by
			default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible. You break
			them.
		</p>
		<h2>Even the best can be improved</h2>
		<p>
			If you can bring this website further beyond perfection,
